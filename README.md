# time series anomoly detection
## Description
This project is a beginners project to perform time series analysis using python for detecting anomalies in multi sensor indoor environmental data. The data is not a real world data, but mimics a real world data set by curating a set of sensor values against some random time intervals.
## Methodology
1. Create a time object
2. Generate temperature, humidity and light sensor data
3. Build a data frame
4. Visualize sensor data vs time
5. Remove noise and learn trends
6. Anomoly detection
